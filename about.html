<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I come from a remote village in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, and my journey started at DAV School, Dehra. Growing up in this serene environment, I learned various life skills and made friends, experiencing the ebb and flow of friendships that taught me how to discern good from bad influences. My time at DAV School instilled in me the power of discipline and the value of self-improvement. The school not only emphasized academic excellence but also ingrained values such as hard work, respect, emotions, and motivation, which have been pivotal in shaping my character and outlook on life.</p>

    <p>The second chapter of my life began when I entered college, a transformative period that broadened my perspectives and honed my maturity. I attended Rajiv Gandhi Government Engineering College from 2018 to 2022, where I learned about the uncompromising nature of hard work and its direct correlation to results. College life taught me that people are driven by their needs, and success comes from meeting deadlines and excelling in projects. During this time, I was the head of the Literature Society for the Electrical Engineering department, helping juniors and peers showcase their literary talents. Simultaneously, I prepared for armed forces exams like CDS, AFCAT, and CAPF, driven by a passion for military knowledge, geography, and defense exercises. Although I cleared AFCAT, I was ineligible for AFSB and soon after, I found a new passion in coding, studying Python and SQL.</p>
    
    <p>This newfound interest in coding marked a significant turning point in my life. After completing my B.Tech, I realized I enjoyed the intellectual challenge of working on a laptop more than the physical rigor of military life. This led me to secure a job as a Technical Engineer at FarEye in Noida, a logistics SaaS company. My first experience living in a city was filled with exploration and learning, both professionally and personally. Working with diverse age groups, I built a strong network that helped me grow. Today, I continue to learn new skills, balancing my time between office work and self-study. This busy but fulfilling lifestyle has improved my quality of life, allowing me to enjoy both my professional achievements and personal relationships. I am grateful for the journey and the experiences that have shaped who I am today.</p>
